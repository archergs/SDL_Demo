# SDL_Demo
A demo of an SDL program. Spawns a small window with a few circles and a movable rectangle (use arrow keys!). Meant to demo a 
basic SDL program, although it may evolve into something else in the future

# Compile
Make sure you have SDL dev libraries, g++ and cmake installed, then:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
```

Should work on macOS, Linux and Windows, however it's only been tested on the first
